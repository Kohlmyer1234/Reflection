this week we leared about XML and HTML. XML you can make nodes and endless subnodes for any reson you can think of. an example of this is <animals> </animals>. the first part is the opening of the node and the second part is closed using the / mark. HTML we made small web page with about five lines of code. <B> </B> is the same as XML where the first part is opening the command and the second part is closed with the / mark.
