this week we leared how to encript massages. Useing the ceaser chifer code you can shift letter. Using a shift of e for example would change the letter A to the letter E change the letter B to the the letter F. Also it is very easy to decript a message back to a regular state i would take about 12 lines of code to change it back.

this week we leared about XML and HTML. XML you can make nodes and endless subnodes for any reson you can think of. an example of this is <animals> </animals>. the first part is the opening of the node and the second part is closed using the / mark. HTML we made small web page with about five lines of code. <B> </B> is the same as XML where the first part is opening the command and the second part is closed with the / mark.
